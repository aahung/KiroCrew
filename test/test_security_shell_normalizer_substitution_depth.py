"""``_SubstitutionDepth``: the case-aware successor to the paren counter.

Every argv window on the floor stops at the first token that ends the argv
while no command substitution is open.  Measured with the bare
``_substitution_depth_delta`` -- a per-token character count with no shell
grammar -- a ``case`` PATTERN's ``)`` (the token ``x)``) scores as a
substitution closer and a pattern's ``|`` (``x|y)``) as a separator, so such a
window closes at the first list operator after ``esac`` and every later clause
is lost.  These tests pin the walker on the token shapes the tokenizer
actually produces (``$(case``, ``x)``, ``(x)``, ``x|y)``, ``:;;``, ``esac;``,
``esac)``), each measured against what bash spans.
